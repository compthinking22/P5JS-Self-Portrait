NOT FINISHED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

NARRATIVE

Imagine you are a tree.
As you move the mouse, your leaves change.
As you click the mouse, your leaves fall.
With each click of the mouse, more leaves fall --
Until the branches are bare.
Things seem as if they'll never change.
But it isn't over, is it?
With one more click of the mouse, the leaves are back,
and the cycle starts again.

On the opening screen, I have the word "Abscission" along with it's botanical definition. Once the screen fades, the user is given directions on what to do-- keys "A", "S", and "D"
change the colors of the sky, the mouse changes the colors of the leaves (healthy leaves to dark brown means weathering trees) and then clicks of the mouse to drop the leaves. This 
project is a visual representation of Abscission. This project is also a visual representation of the dying/aging of the old self to bring upon the new self -- which usually (or hopefully) brings upon new/happy beginnings. This is my self portrait because I've gone through difficult things in my life and to overcome the emotions and pain that they've caused me, the "dying" of my old self happened -- routine changes, thought pattern changes, how I appreciate things, and many other things that are overall positive that make me who I am today.  However, just like the visual representation, those old habits, thoughts, and feelings can come again and make it feel as though that you want to escape or that things are over... But, if you push yourself one last time -- the click of a button -- beauty and happiness will come out of it again. 

I really like how my project turned out, and although it's pretty simple to mess with, I'm glad that I was able to create something that holds a lot of meaning to me. I hope this description is understandable enough, and I hope that after reading it, it makes things seem just a bit easier for you.

(On a side note, I also really like plants, the sky, and the clouds. They've helped me through my toughest times and even though some of them died, they still came back and showed
their beauty.) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The idea I had for this project was something meditative – the original idea was to make clouds moving but I saw some scary examples and saw how difficult that was. I felt really defeated as clouds were really important to me, but after a few days of thinking I got the idea to do trees. I was really happy about this idea as it is interactive (mouse movement to change colors of the tree leaves and mouse clicking to “drop”). Clearly, I was able to do that and more! I knew that this new idea would be better and would actually work the way I wanted it to because of the examples I saw online. 
Before the first Milestone, I created the background, the ground, and then the first layer of circles (my canvas started at 800x600). This was the easiest part. I then started positioning the circles (which took a while for me to figure out how to do). After this, I created the first color changing layer and then applied that to more arrays of circles – at this point, I started having issues having the colors change the way I wanted them too (it was a really stupid number in an equation that needed to be changed). I used chat gpt at this point to help me understand what was wrong and it made everything so much worse. I was struggling for 5 days until a teacher from work was like “it has to be something with the positioning/length of something” – low and behold, it was and I was so annoyed that I was that blinded for a week. I was incredibly mind blown. After this, I enlarged my canvas to be windowWidth x windowHeight and had the very tedious task of rearranging the circles to be in the positions I wanted them to be in – mind you, I only had one “half-tree” (aka just leaves) and random circles in random placement. Finally, I started doing some research on how to make trees and ended up finding a code online. By the first Milestone, I have 1 complete tree, the color changing leaves, the ground, a background, and random tree trunks/branches and color changing circles around.

Before the second Milestone, I was able to create more working circles, and I moved the tree trunks/branches to where I wanted them to be – I had my project mostly down! At the time, I only had one background color so I decided to try to make a keyPressed function to be able to change the background – this was pretty easy… I had some issues with the background overlaying the trees, but with the help of the professor we figured out that it was just being called in the wrong spot. After this, he also helped me figure out my issues with the mousePressed – we basically did a manual “loop” (I actually would’ve never thought about the idea he gave but it worked great!!). The day after the Second Milestone, the visual portion of my project was fully complete!

Throughout the project I had tons of simple mistakes and eureka moments once I figured them out. Honestly, each step of my project was a eureka moment but I will name a few key moments – figuring out the array for the x and y coordinates for the circles, how to make them change color the way I need to (also making certain things into global variables), understanding the recursion function that I found for the trees, and picking specific colors for the project (sounds very simple, but it’s definitely not!). Some of the problems that I had before the eureka moments was when the circles were “stuck” at one color instead of transitioning the way I wanted them to (i forget exactly what caused that specific issues, but it had to do with the equation that I had an the overall function I created for the color changing). I also had problems with the mouse click and background layering over the circles – these were easy fixes (thanks, professor!). The most frustrating thing was figuring out the color transitioning with the circles and also the very tedious positioning of them (it was HORRIBLE – But, very satisfying once I got them in the right spots). When I was having trouble, I would use chat gpt to tell me what I was doing wrong in my code and would use some ideas to help me figure out what I could be doing wrong – it’s easier for me to understand what I’m doing wrong if I look at examples and implement little things to help my code be better.



PROGRAMMING FUNDAMENTALS

My code definitely demonstrates my basic understanding of javascript – although I did get some help from online for something, I understand EXACTLY what is going on in the code. Since I already have a basic understanding of how code works, learning JS wasn’t too difficult.
