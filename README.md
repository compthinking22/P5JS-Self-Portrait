Imagine you are a tree.
As you move the mouse, your leaves change.
As you click the mouse, your leaves fall.
With each click of the mouse, more leaves fall --
Until the branches are bare.
Things seems as if they'll never change.
But it isn't over, is it?
With one more click of the mouse, the leaves are back,
and the cycle starts again.

On the opening screen, I have the word "Abscission" along with it's botanical definition. Once the screen fades, the user is given directions on what to do-- keys "A", "S", and "D"
change the colors of the sky, the mouse changes the colors of the leaves (healthy leaves to dark brown means weathering trees) and then clicks of the mouse to drop the leaves. This 
project is a visual representation of Abscission. This project is also a visual representation of the dying/ageing of the old self to bring upon the new self -- which is usually 
(or hopefully) brings upun new/happy beginnings. This is my self protrait because I've gone through difficult things in my life and to overcome the emotions and pain that they've caused me, 
the "dying" of my old self happened -- routine changes, thought pattern changes, how I appreciate things, and many other things that are overall positive that make me who I am today. 
Hoever, just like the visual representation, those old habits, thoughts, and feelings can come again and make it feel as though that you want to escape or that things are over... But, if you 
push yourself one last time -- the click of a button -- beauty and happiness will come out of it again. 

I really like how my project turned out, and although it's pretty simple to mess with, I'm glad that I was able to create something that holds a lot of meaning to me. I hope this
description is understandable enough, and I hope that after reading it, it makes things seem just a bit more easier for you.

(On a side note, I also really like plants, the sky, and the clouds. They've helped me through my toughest times and even though some of them died, they still came back and showed
me their beauty.)
